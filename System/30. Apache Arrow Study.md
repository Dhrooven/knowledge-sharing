# Apache Arrow Study

Apache Arrow is a columnar, in-memory, cross-language data layout format.

It is a building block for big data systems, focusing on efficient data transfers between machines in a cluster and between different big data systems.

## Table Storage -> Columnar -> Arrow

Many people model their data in a set of two-dimensional tables where each row corresponds to an entity, and each column an attribute about that entity.

However, storage is one-dimensional -- you can only read data sequentially from memory or disk in one dimension.

Therefore, there are two primary options for storing tables on storage:
- Store one row sequentially, followed by the next row, and then the next one, etc; 
- Store the first column sequentially, followed by the next column, and then the next one, etc.

Apache Arrow is a columnar data representation format that accelerates data analytics workloads.

On top of the format, Apache Arrow offers a set of libraries (including C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, MATLAB, Python, R, Ruby, and Rust), to work with data in the Apache Arrow format.

## Data Transfer -> (De)serialization -> Zero-copy -> Arrow

Typically, a data transfer consists of:

- serializing data in a format
- sending the serialized data over a network connection
- deserializing the data on the receiving side

An example is as below:

In this process, there is one factor we control in software: (de)serialization.

Serialization converts the memory used by objects into a common format.

The format has a specification, and for each programming language and platform, a library is provided converting objects to serialized form and back.

When we are transferring lots of data, it will become a big bottleneck. Hence, can we eliminate the serialization process in those cases?

This is actually the goal of zero-copy serialization frameworks, such as Apache Arrow and FlatBuffers.

Zero-copy refers here to the fact that the bytes you application works on can be transferred over the wire without any modification. Likewise, on the receiving end, the application can start working on the bytes as is, without a deserialization step.
